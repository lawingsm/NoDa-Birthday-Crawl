# # NoDa Twenty-First Birthday Crawl 

### Route Map 

--- 
This map provides a route through the North Davidson district in Charlotte, NC. This area has been experiencing gentrification since the late 1990s. NoDa has become a popular spot for those living in Charlotte and has activities for everyone. Using [Maps to GPX] (https://mapstogpx.com/) I turned my google maps directions into a gpx file. Then I used [geojson.io] (https://geojson.io/#map=2/0/20) to turn my GPX file into a GeoJSON. To insert a map into my webpage I used [Leaflet] (https://leafletjs.com/index.html) which let me choose from numerous open source maps. I used my GeoJSON to include points and a line in my web map.
